Install Docker Desktop (https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), or use the appropriate package manager on a UNIX based system. 
(Homebrew will likely be the best for Mac, but research your linux distro to use the package manager it was installed with. 
The command will likely look like this:    "sudo PACKAGE_MANAGER_NAME install docker"

Open CMD as admin if you are running a Windows machine, or if using an apple or mac device use the sudo prefix before each command, navigate to folder with Dockerfile

Run "docker build -t NAME_OF_IMAGE ./" (this image name will be chosen by you)

Run "docker run --name NAME_OF_CONTAINER -v SOME_FILE_PATH/pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432 NAME_OF_IMAGE" (the container name will be chosen by you)

Navigate to the File path provided in the previous step, then into the new pgdata folder

Paste data.csv (Our test data) into this folder

In a new cmd window run "docker exec -it NAME_OF_CONTAINER psql -U postgres -d dynamSystems

This should give a shell within the docker container

In this shell, run "\copy data FROM '/var/lib/postgresql/data/data.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;"


This should get the database setup and populated. Now you should be able to connect using this info
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
User: postgres
Password: docker
Database Name: dynamSystems
Table Name: public.data

You'll only need to follow these inital steps the very first time you set it up, after that you should be able to just restart the container by using 

docker start NAME_OF_CONTAINER 

in a cmd, and the database should persist
